cake-cutting
============

This is a Java applet that uses linear programming (via gurobi) to solve fair cake-cutting problems. Should be relatively self-explanatory, but will add more information and fixes as ambiguities and bugs inevitably crop up.

NOTES
=====
01.01.2015: To start off the new year, I've decided to revive a small, semi-personal project I did the summer between my junior and senior years in high school! Unfortunately, in uploading this rep I realized that I actually have to wait until I move back to campus on 01/08 before I can do anything, since my gurobi license expired and I have to be connected to an academic domain to activate my new license :(
